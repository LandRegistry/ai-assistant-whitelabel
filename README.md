This is a copy of the GOV prototyping kit with our white label version of the caseworker AI assistant. 

We've removed the real content and replaced it with fictional information - so the design can be seen. 

To run the prototype:
- node 18 is needed
- run `npm init` to install node modules
- use `npm run dev`

You can read more about the work we've done in the [govuk-design-system GitHub discussions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/discussions/3804#discussioncomment-13944768)
